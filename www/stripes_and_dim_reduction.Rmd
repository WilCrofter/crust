### Terminology

The *null space* of a matrix, $S$, consists of all vectors, $v$, such that $Sv = 0$. It is called a *space* because it is closed under vector addition and multiplication by scalars. That is, if $Sv_i = 0$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$ and $\alpha_1, \ldots \alpha_n$ are scalars, then $S\(\alpha_1v_1 + \ldots + \alpha_nv_n)= 0$ as well. This is easily seen since$$S(\alpha_1v_1 + \ldots + \alpha_nv_n)= \alpha_1Sv_1 + \ldots + \alpha_nSv_n \\ = \alpha_10 + \ldots + \alpha_n0 \\ = 0.$$

A matrix is *singular* if its null space includes vectors other than the vector of all zeros. If a matrix is singular, then its null space is of infinite extent because, for example, you can multiply by an arbitrarily large scalar and remain in the space.

The tomography problems of interest here are characterized by incomplete information. That is to say, the measured data does not uniquely determine an image. In the formal terminology of the preceding paragraphs, the system matrices of interest are singular. Hence, if $S$ is a system matrix and $Sb = \tau$, then for any $v$ in the null space of $S$,$$S(b+v)=Sb+Sv=Sb+0=\tau.$$Thus there is an infinite set of "images" which result in precisely the same times of flight.

The total time of flight along a path is unaffected if time is subtracted from one segment of the path and the same amount added at another. This is the origin of the so-called "stripe space" as was explained in detail in a [previous note](S_kernel_etc.html). The stripe space is always contained in the null space of the associated system matrix. The null space itself may be strictly larger, but it cannot be smaller.

The stripe space corresponds to images in which all pixels in a given column have the same value, hence form a stripe, and such that sum of the values of all pixels is zero. It is easily verified that such images are closed under componentwise addition and multiplication by scalars, hence form a vector space.

Two vectors, $u$ and $v$, are *orthogonal* if their dot product, $u \bullet v$, is zero. If a vector, $u$, is orthogonal to *every* $v$ in the stripe space, $u$ is said to be in the *orthogonal complement* of the stripe space. The orthogonal complement of the stripe space is, itself, a vector space. The proof follows directly from definitions.

The *projection* of a vector $v$ onto a vector space is the closest point to $v$ in that space, where "closest" is in the sense of least squares, i.e., in the sense of Euclidean distance. The operation of projecting a vector onto a space can be represented by a matrix. How this is done is detailed in [this note](projection_regularization).
