This note documents creation of a large, pixelated thigh section at several resolutions. The eventual objective is to explore image reconstruction from two or more overlapping scans on the same grid. Though short of a full, tomographic scan, the overlapping section should have improved resolution. (Line artifacts in the images are very likely the fault of graphing packages.)

```{r fig.align='center', message=FALSE, fig.width=4}
source("../R/inkscape_utils.R")
phantom <- importIPhantom("../data/thigh_inkscape.csv")
plotIPhantom(phantom, main="Section")
scan <- matrix(c(0,200,190,200,190,0,0,0), 4,2, byrow=TRUE)
overlayRectangle(scan, lwd=4, border="red")
for(res in 2^(4:7)){
  # gridsize is based on a 60 mm probe width and res transducers.
  gridsize <- 60*mean(1/c(res-.5, res-1.5)) 
  img <- pixelate(phantom, scan, gridsize)
  colnames(img) <- as.character(signif(gridsize*(1:ncol(img)-1),4))
  image(x=(1:nrow(img))*gridsize, y=(1:ncol(img))*gridsize, img, asp=1, 
        xlab = "x (mm)", ylab="y (mm)", main=paste("Grid size:", signif(gridsize,4), "mm"))
  outf <- paste0("../data","/whole_thigh_",res,".csv")
  write.csv(as.data.frame(img),outf, row.names=FALSE)
}
```
