This note documents creation of a large, pixelated thigh section at several resolutions. The eventual objective is to explore image reconstruction from two or more overlapping scans on the same grid. Though short of a full, tomographic scan, the overlapping section should have improved resolution. (Line artifacts in the final image are probably the fault of graphing packages.)

```{r fig.align='center', message=FALSE, fig.width=4}
source("../R/inkscape_utils.R")
phantom <- importIPhantom("../data/thigh_inkscape.csv")
plotIPhantom(phantom, main="Section")
scan <- matrix(c(0,200,0,0,190,0,190,200), 4,2, byrow=TRUE)
overlayRectangle(scan, lwd=4, border="red")
# Utility to calculate gridsize in mm which will give a certain height, h, in pixels
# for a given rectangle, r.
calcGridSize <- function(r, h){
  hv <- r[4,] - r[1,]
  lhv <- sqrt(sum(hv^2))
  mean(c(lhv/(h-.5), lhv/(h-1.5)))
}
for(res in 2^(4:7)){
  gridsize <- calcGridSize(scan, res)
  # adjust for height of 200 vs probe height of 60
  gridsize <- gridsize*60/200 
  img <- pixelate(phantom, scan, gridsize)
  colnames(img) <- as.character(signif(gridsize*(1:ncol(img)-1),4))
  image(x=(1:nrow(img))*gridsize, y=(1:ncol(img))*gridsize, img, asp=1, 
        xlab = "x (mm)", ylab="y (mm)", main=paste("Grid size:", signif(gridsize,4), "mm"))
  outf <- paste0("../data","/whole_thigh_",res,".csv")
  write.csv(as.data.frame(img),outf, row.names=FALSE)
}
```
