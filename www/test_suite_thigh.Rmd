This note is to document construction of a test suite of images, system matrices, and time of flight data based on a [phantom thigh section](thigh_working_prototype.html). The suite will not involve misalignment or noise, at least initially. It will involve rectangular sections at various positions and orientations and digitized at various resolutions (pixel sizes.)

The first task is to identify rectangular sections. This is a trial and error process, and was performed off-line. Resulting sections are shown below in various colors.

```{r fig.align='center', fig.width=4.4, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
source("../R/inkscape_utils.R")

# Utility to compute base and height in pixels, given a rectangle and gridsize.
# It was used to ensure that heights in pixels would be powers of 2 when images
# were pixelated. The height in pixels will be equal to the number of transducers
# when a system matrix is calculated via genS or its C counterpart.
pixi <- function(r, gridsize){
  # assuming rectangle corners are arranged in clockwise order,
  # compute oriented base and height
  bv <- r[2,]-r[1,]
  hv <- r[4,]-r[1,]
  # rectangle dimensions in integer multiples of gridsize
  b <- ceiling(.5+sqrt(sum(bv^2))/gridsize)
  h <- ceiling(.5+sqrt(sum(hv^2))/gridsize)
  # gridsize increments for base and height
  bi <- gridsize*bv/(sqrt(sum(bv^2)))
  hi <- gridsize*hv/(sqrt(sum(hv^2)))
  c(h, b)
}

rect1 <- computeRectangle(phantom, c(100,100), pi/4, 127*.23)
```


phantom <- importIPhantom("../data/thigh_inkscape.csv")
plotIPhantom(phantom)
```
